# Algorithms in JS

A repository showing my experience implementing algorithms in Javascript, including a few common
questions asked in interviews related to arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming.

See the `/graph-viewer` directory for a 3d graph viewer that uses the `three.js` library for visualizing BFS and DFS algorithms.
